Collections/Data Structures
HashMap, LinkedHashMap, HashSet, Hash table, TreeSet,
HashCode and Equals
Set stores Objects, Map stores as Key value pair
Keys are unique and Values can be duplicated.
TreeMap, HashMap and LinkedHashMap are classes.
LinkedHashMap offers 0(1) lookup and insertion. Keys are ordered by their insertion order. It is implemented by doubly-linked buckets.
TreeMap offers O(log N) lookup and insertion. Keys are ordered, so if you need to iterate through the keys in sorted order, you can. This means that keys must implement the Comparable interface. TreeMap is implemented by a Red-Black Tree.
ArrayList, LinkedList
Comparable interface and comparator interface
Comparable object can be compared itself with instances of same class - Sorting
